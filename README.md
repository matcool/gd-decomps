# gd-decomps

Some of my decompilations of gd functions, as a geode mod

Members used in the code are from whatever geode had at the time \
There may be quite a few unknown members, or even raw offset members, as it's a lot of work to figure out a specific member

If there are any raw offsets, they are from the windows version of the game (sorry mac)
